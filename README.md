# Branch-expansion-ml-golomt-bank-mongolia
ML-based location optimization for Golomt bank branch placement in Mongolia using public data
# Data Sources
- Population & workforce statistics by district (soum = districts)
- Loan, deposit, and transaction volumes
- Account and branch counts across all banks
- Golomt Bankâ€™s existing branch locations
- Company registration data
- Loan delinquency and overdue ratios
- Custom-defined clusters of similar districts (for intra-cluster ranking)

# Methodology
1) Feature Engineering
   - Underserved demand indicators (e.g., low account penetration per capita)
   - Opportunity signals (e.g., loan volume in underbanked areas)
   - Saturation & workload metrics (e.g., branch density, account-per-branch load)
   - Risk indicators (e.g., delinquency and overdue loan ratios)
3) Scoring Model
   - Log and square-root transformations for skewed distributions
   - Min-max normalization across features
   - Weighted aggregation of normalized features into a composite score
   - Risk penalization (e.g., halve score for delinquency > 20%)
   - Ranking by cluster
